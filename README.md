1.   QUESTION/   DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY
This assignment makes   up 40% of the overall   mark for the course.   It   is a   group   assessment   with   individual contributions. The assessment should   include an   input from each group member.
Throughout the course of this   module, you   have learned about the different   stakeholders   impacted by organisations, and about the dynamics and   concepts   that   shape   the   behaviour of individuals, groups and leaders within them. You   have also   learned   about   the   Scottish   Fair   Work   Framework, and this knowledge will inform. this assessment.
You   have each been   placed   in teams. You are to select a   real-life   organisation   based   in   the   home country of one of your team members, and   give   a   15-20   minute   presentation   to   the organisation to persuade the board of directors to   implement the fair work framework for   staff. The principles of this framework are effective voice, opportunity, security, fulfilment   and   respect. Your presentation should   include:
●          A very brief overview of the   organisation
●          Identification of the key stakeholders for the   organisation   (primary and   secondary)
●          Clear, detailed and evidence-based arguments explaining   how these   principles will   impact positively on core areas of   HR,   including   at   a   minimum:

-   Retention
- Skills and   staff development
-   Diversity and   inclusion
-   Individual   performance
●          You should then build on these   arguments to   present   a   convincing   case   of   how   this   can   improve overall organisational   performance to benefit all stakeholders
Please   keep   in mind that   most board of directors are   likely to   be   hesitant   about   aspects   of the fair work framework, because of cost implications or autocratic   management   policies, however it   is your   job to   persuade them with the strength of your arguments.   Please   also   make sure you are drawing from strong academic sources and   citing   them   properly   using the   Harvard system.
2.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   FOR GROUP ASSIGNMENTS
You   have been   placed   in your group at   random and   students   are   not allowed   in   any   circumstances to choose your own teammates. You will know who you are   working   with   by   the second tutorial. You are expected to   provide a   groupwork   contract   agreed   upon   by   all members of the team by   a date provided to you   by the   course   coordinator.
In addition to this,   students will be   expected to   complete   an   evaluation   of   all   group   members’   participation   (including their own) in this group assessment as follows:
●          A group task   involves several distinct stages.   In this self-assessment you   are   asked   to consider the contributions   made by each   of the group,   including yourself to these   different stages.   Members of your group may have contributed   more to   some   areas      than others.
●          Please use the grid   below and   the   4-point   scoring   system.
